/**
 * Identifies a typical life cycle work-flow for an [AppCompatActivity] or a [Fragment] of the framework. When referring to the
 * [AppCompatActivity] "life cycle", we do not consider the entity instance re-creation due to <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#ConfigurationChanges">configuration changes</a>,
 * for instance. The framework capture those entities work-flow and divides it into typical actions:
 * <p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>set the layout and extract the key widgets,</li>
 * <li>retrieve the business objects are represented on the entity,</li>
 * <li>bind the entity widgets to the previously extracted business objects,</li>
 * <li>when an [AppCompatActivity] has been stacked over the current entity task, and the navigation comes back to the entity, refresh the widgets with
 * the potential business objects new values.</li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When deriving from this interface, just implement this interface method. You do not need to override the traditional [AppCompatActivity]
 * {[AppCompatActivity.onCreate]/[AppCompatActivity.onStart]/[AppCompatActivity.onResume] method nor the [Fragment]
 * [Fragment.onCreate]/[Fragment.onStart]/[Fragment.onResume] methods, even if you still are allowed to.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The `onXXX` methods should never be invoked because they are callbacks, and that only the framework should invoke them during the entity life
 * cycle!
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In the code, the interface methods are sorted in chronological order of invocation by the framework.
